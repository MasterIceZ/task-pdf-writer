**v.1.2.1 stable update** (Yes I surely hope it is stable)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plumsirawit/task-pdf-writer/main/public/task-pdf-writer-banner.svg)

This project is a website as a tool/service to maintain PDF production for competitive programming tasks. The PDFs generated by this tool have the same appearance as from the IOI's translation system. In fact, this project's back-end is copied and modified from IOI 2017's translation system to support the serverless framework (to reduce operation costs). The back-end uses the serverless framework on AWS Lambda. For the front-end, this project uses firebase, Next.js, and Vercel.

The main website is hosted [here](https://pdf.graders.me/). However, you can fork, edit, and host your own versions too.

Feel free to open pull requests if you want to contribute ðŸ˜ƒ. Also, if you found any bugs or problems please report by creating new GitHub issues.

## Getting Started (front-end and Nextjs back-end)

First, install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

This project requires two additional environment variables: `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` and `COOKIE_SECRET_CURRENT`. `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` is the private key of the firebase project. In case of external development, you can start a new firebase project and generate the private key. After that you'll need to edit the firebase config in `constants.ts`. For `COOKIE_SECRET_CURRENT`, this can be any secure random string.

Then run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Getting Started (AWS back-end)

First, change directory to `aws-python-api` and install dependencies:

```bash
cd aws-python-api
npm i
```

Most of the installing tasks are done in the `Dockerfile`. You'll need to have docker installed before building docker images locally.

For anything else, you can edit the files as a serverless project. You'll need to login to serverless in order to deploy, then `npm run deploy` to deploy.
